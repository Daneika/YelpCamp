# YelpCamp

A simplfied version of Yelp for campsites allowing users to add new campgrounds, leave comments and edit information.

My first full application combining HTML, CSS and JS.

Followed [The Web Developer Bootcamp - Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

## Requirements

In order to run the application locally you will need to have the following:

- Run [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) locally with a yelp_camp db
- Run `npm install`

To run the application use the command `npm run start`
